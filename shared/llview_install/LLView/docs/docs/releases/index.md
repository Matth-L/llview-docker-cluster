# LLview Internal Releases

A simplified package of LLview is also available Open Source on GitHub. [See more](public.md)

Developments on the internal releases of LLview are not following the new implementations as the public one. New fixes and improvements done on the internal releases are brought periodically to the public release, but not vice-versa. The versions of the internal "releases" are kept in place for simplicity.
A single version of JURI is used for both internal and public versions of LLview. [See here the changelog for JURI](juri.md).

### 2.1.0 (August 4, 2023)

LLview got constant updates in the last months. Apart from the general improvements, an important recent adition was the inclusion of new [core usage metrics](../jobreport/metrics_list.md). New values are added to the tables of active and finished jobs, graphs were added to the footer when a job is selected (including a new footer tab `Cores`), and new graphs were added to the PDF and HTML reports. 

The new metrics can help users, admins and support staff to find wrong configuration or pinning on jobs - as discussed in [this example](../jobreport/examples.md#high-cpu-load-with-low-cpu-usage).
